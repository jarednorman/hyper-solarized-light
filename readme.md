# Solarized Right Theme for Hyper

A port of the [Solarized Light](http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized) colour
scheme for [Hyper.app](https://hyper.is/) based off of
[hyper-solarized-light](https://github.com/ghosh/hyper-solarized-light).

This fork exists because the original was not using the "correct" colours and
was unusable with the official Vim colourscheme.
